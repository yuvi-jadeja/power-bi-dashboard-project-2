Data Professional Survey Breakdown: Insights from 630 Global Participants Using Power BI

In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyse survey data from 630 data professionals across various countries. The survey covered several critical aspects, including job titles, preferred programming languages, work/life balance, and salary satisfaction.

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth look at the demographics and preferences of data professionals. Key visualizations include the distribution of job titles, trends in programming language popularity, and correlations between work/life balance and salary satisfaction.

This project showcases my expertise in using Power BI to transform raw survey data into meaningful insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the preferences and satisfaction levels of data professionals worldwide.
